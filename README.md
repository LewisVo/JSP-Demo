# JSP Demo

This small project showcases many functional operations that JSP can do. 

## Requirements 

- Oracle Java JDK 8 (Open JDK and lower than version 8 not tested)
- Tomcat 8.0.x (higher version not tested)
- Eclipse (this is my IDE, optional of course).

**Minor notes**: Important codes not only lie in /src folder.
